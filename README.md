simple machine learning

The program spawns a population of ball objects that will intilaly randomly move until it eveuntaullay learns to go towards the end, when it hits the obstacle it eventually learns to go around it. 

generally by gen 20 it will reach the end and attempt to go faster everytime. by gen 100 it has increased in speed drammativally. furthest ive left it is gen 600 where it could reach the finish in 271 steps

This is my first attempt to create a machine learning algorthm, it uses a simple version of NEAT to replicated human evolution and allow the balls to learn.

the program is written in python and doesent use any libraries, though I plan to use them for neaural networks on a later project
